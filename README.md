# Wordle
A simple Wordle clone in Java, using JavaFX as the UI.

<hr>

##### Probably better to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript or make it a web app than this.

Decided to stay with JavaFX due to SceneBuilder, with the ease of making grids and such.

Features:
* Menu bar that allows to reset the game and shows the basic rules of wordle.
* Minimal error handling for the word input
* A text box for typing instead of keyboard GUI (at least you can press enter or the submit button)

Lacks:
* An easy way for players to keep note of letters that haven't been played yet (a.k.a. Keyboard GUI)
* Animations
* Additional bug testing

My plans:
* Create as executable file
* Send to friends for fun
* Create a seperate repository to suggest words (Information Theory)
